    <h2>diaries of an orientation leader</h2>

i’m learning so much from my freshmen at the international orientation. being a leader is so much work considering it’s unpaid but it’s so cool to see the effect of your work when people who would otherwise never talk to each other share conversations and bond over small stuff. like hell yeah
<br><br>
also realized everybody is in their own little bubbles and everybody can sometimes feel lonely and left out regardless of being an athlete/frat boy/minority. it’s a universal human experience and it took me so long to realize that i am the one responsible for initiating conversations and befriending others and making them feel like they belong in every space where i am. saying hi, smiling, looking into someone’s eyes and acknowledging their existence can go such a long way to make people feel welcome in any social setting and i am so excited to be around wonderful people this year. 
<br><br>
i love the international community, i love my college and i love how every little interaction can teach me soo much about how to be a better human. my freshmen think i got it figured out but the truth is i am just as lost as they are.
<br><br>
i am learning to be graceful and forgiving, not to hold people’s ignorance and mistakes against them, not to take things personally and just be here to enjoy our shared human experience. it is such a privilege for me to be able to live this life and i am soo lucky that i get to interact with a bunch of new faces. 
<br><br>
in high school i thought all the volunteering positions were a scam because you don’t get anything out of them, but honestly interacting with others and forcing yourself to take agency in uncomfortable situations is the best way to become a better communicator (and that’s priceless). challenge yourself and do something you’re afraid of every day !!!<br> <br>просыпаюсь.
