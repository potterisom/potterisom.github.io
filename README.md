# Leyla Salken
Hi! I'm studying Mathematics at Williams College, MA, USA. I am currently doing a year abroad program at Oxford University.
This website contains some of the work I do, including expository papers, articles and short notes, visualizations, content I've enjoyed, my thoughts, and my CV.
If you want to offer me a job, send a joke, or discuss any of the stuff published here, please contact me at leylasalken [at] gmail [dot] com.
